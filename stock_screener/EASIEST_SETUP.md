# The EASIEST Pabbly Setup (No Iterator!)

## 🎉 Python Does the Work, Pabbly Just Sends It

Your Python script now generates the **complete HTML email** and sends it to Pabbly.

Pabbly simply receives the ready-to-send HTML and forwards it via Gmail.

**No Iterator. No Text Formatter. No complexity.**

---

## 📊 What Changed

### Old Way (Complex):
```
Railway → Sends JSON array → Pabbly Iterator → Text Formatter → Aggregate → Gmail
                              ❌ Complex!
```

### New Way (Simple):
```
Railway → Sends Complete HTML → Pabbly → Gmail
                                ✅ Easy!
```

---

## 🚀 Pabbly Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Webhook Trigger ✅
Already configured! Your webhook receives data from Railway.

### Step 2: Add Gmail Action

In Pabbly, add: **Gmail → Send Email**

**Settings:**
- **To:** `ariasgon@msn.com`
- **From:** `sales@forjaanalytics.com` (or your verified sender)
- **Subject:** `{1. Subject}`
- **Body Type:** HTML
- **Body:** `{1. Html Email}`

That's it! Just insert the single variable `{1. Html Email}` in the body.
