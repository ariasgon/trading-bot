## üí° Tips

### Customize the threshold
Want 40% drops instead of 30%?

Edit `screener.py` line 163:
```python
# Change from:
if drop_pct <= -30:

# To:
if drop_pct <= -40:
```

### Add more stocks
Edit `get_sp500_symbols()` method in `screener.py` to add more tickers.

### Change schedule
Adjust cron in Railway:
- `0 21 * * 1-5` = Weekdays 4 PM ET
- `0 22 * * *` = Daily 5 PM ET
- `0 14 * * 1` = Mondays 9 AM ET

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Email not sending"
- Use App Password, not Gmail password
- Enable 2-Step Verification first
- Copy the 16-char password exactly

### "No fundamentals data"
- Check FMP API key is correct
- Verify at: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/dashboard

### "Not finding stocks"
- This is normal! If market is up, fewer stocks will be down 30%
- Lower threshold to -20% if you want more results
