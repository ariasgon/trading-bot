# Alpaca Trailing Stops Research & Implementation Guide

**Date:** January 2025
**Research Topic:** Trailing stop functionality to move stops along during trade lifecycle to protect profits

---

## ✅ Summary: YES, It's Plausible!

Alpaca API **DOES support trailing stops**, but with important limitations regarding bracket orders. There are **two implementation approaches** available.

---

## 🔍 What Are Trailing Stops?

Trailing stops automatically adjust the stop price as the market moves in your favor:
- **For LONG positions:** Stop price moves UP as stock price rises (but never down)
- **For SHORT positions:** Stop price moves DOWN as stock price falls (but never up)

**Example:**
- Buy stock at $100
- Set trailing stop with 2% trail
- Stock rises to $110 → stop automatically adjusts to $107.80 (110 × 0.98)
- Stock rises to $120 → stop adjusts to $117.60 (120 × 0.98)
- Stock falls to $115 → stop stays at $117.60 (locks in profit)
- If stock drops to $117.60 → stop triggers, exits at ~$117.60

**Your Goal:** "Avoid trade going back to negative" ✅ Trailing stops solve this perfectly!

## 📊 Alpaca's Trailing Stop Support

### ✅ What's Supported

1. **Standalone Trailing Stop Orders** (fully supported)
   - Submit as separate order after entry fills
   - Automatic stop price adjustment
   - Two trail methods: dollar amount or percentage

2. **Parameters Available**
   - `trail_price`: Dollar offset (e.g., $2.00 = stop at high_water_mark - $2.00)
   - `trail_percent`: Percentage offset (e.g., 1.0 = stop at high_water_mark × 0.99)

3. **Response Fields**
   - `hwm` (high water mark): Continuously updates as price moves favorably
   - `stop_price`: Auto-calculated from hwm and trail parameters
   - Trail parameters can be updated via PATCH before trigger

### ❌ Current Limitation

**CANNOT use trailing stops as part of bracket orders (yet)**

From Alpaca documentation:
> "Trailing stop orders are currently supported only with single orders. However, we plan to support trailing stop as the stop loss leg of bracket/OCO orders in the future."

This means your current bracket order implementation (in `order_manager.py` line 206) **cannot** use trailing stops for the stop_loss leg.

### ⚠️ Other Limitations

- **Trading hours only:** "Trailing stop will not trigger outside of the regular market hours"
- **Time-in-force:** Only `day` and `gtc` (good-till-canceled) supported
- **No reversal:** Cannot change from price trailing to percent trailing (or vice versa) once submitted
- **Market execution:** When triggered, becomes market order (execution price may differ from stop price)

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Options

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Use bracket orders for initial protection, then upgrade to trailing stop**

**How it works:**
1. Place bracket order on entry (current implementation - lines 153-252 in order_manager.py)
2. Monitor position until it reaches profitability threshold (e.g., +1% profit)
3. Cancel fixed stop loss from bracket order
4. Submit trailing stop order to replace it
5. Keep take-profit in place

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Immediate downside protection with bracket order
- ✅ Automatic profit protection once profitable
- ✅ Combines best of both worlds

**Implementation Pseudocode:**
```python
# Step 1: Entry with bracket order (already implemented)
order_id = place_bracket_order(
    symbol="AAPL",
    side="buy",
    quantity=100,
    stop_loss=98.00,  # Fixed stop initially
    take_profit=105.00
)

# Step 2: Monitor position (in monitor_positions loop)
if position_profit_percent >= 1.0:  # Once +1% profit
    # Step 3: Cancel the fixed stop loss
    cancel_stop_loss_leg(order_id)

    # Step 4: Submit trailing stop
    submit_trailing_stop(
        symbol="AAPL",
        quantity=100,
        side="sell",  # Exit order
        trail_percent=2.0  # 2% trailing stop
    )
```

**API Call Example:**
```python
# Alpaca API call for trailing stop
self.api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=100,
    side='sell',
    type='trailing_stop',
    trail_percent='2.0',  # 2% trail
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

---

### Option 2: Manual Stop Management

**Continuously update fixed stop loss as price moves**

**How it works:**
1. Place bracket order with fixed stop loss (current implementation)
2. Monitor position continuously
3. When price moves favorably, replace stop loss order with new higher stop
4. Repeat until exit

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works with existing bracket order system
- ✅ Full control over stop adjustment logic
- ✅ Can use custom trailing rules (e.g., based on ATR, support levels)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires constant monitoring and API calls
- ❌ More complex logic
- ❌ Risk of missing updates if bot crashes
- ❌ Higher API usage

**Implementation Pseudocode:**
```python
# In monitor_positions() loop
for position in active_positions:
    current_price = get_current_price(position.symbol)
    current_stop = position.stop_loss

    # Calculate new stop based on trailing logic
    if position.side == 'long':
        new_stop = current_price * 0.98  # 2% trailing

        # Only move stop UP, never down
        if new_stop > current_stop:
            replace_stop_loss_order(
                symbol=position.symbol,
                old_stop=current_stop,
                new_stop=new_stop
            )
```

---

### Option 3: Standalone Trailing Stops (NOT RECOMMENDED for your use case)

**Skip bracket orders entirely, use trailing stops only**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Native Alpaca trailing stop handling
- ✅ Automatic adjustment without monitoring

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ No take-profit order (must exit manually or with separate logic)
- ❌ No fixed stop protection if trade immediately goes against you
- ❌ Loses the "bracket order" simplicity

---

## 📋 Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Trailing Stop Support

1. Add trailing stop submission method to `order_manager.py`:

```python
def place_trailing_stop(
    self,
    symbol: str,
    side: str,  # 'sell' for long positions, 'buy' for short positions
    quantity: int,
    trail_percent: float = None,
    trail_price: float = None
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Place a trailing stop order.

    Args:
        symbol: Stock symbol
        side: 'sell' for long positions, 'buy' for short
        quantity: Number of shares
        trail_percent: Percentage trail (e.g., 2.0 for 2%)
        trail_price: Dollar trail (e.g., 2.00 for $2 trail)

    Note: Must provide either trail_percent OR trail_price (not both)
    """
    try:
        if quantity <= 0:
            logger.error(f"Invalid quantity: {quantity}")
            return None

        if trail_percent is None and trail_price is None:
            logger.error("Must provide trail_percent or trail_price")
            return None

        if trail_percent is not None and trail_price is not None:
            logger.error("Cannot provide both trail_percent and trail_price")
            return None

        # Build order parameters
        order_params = {
            'symbol': symbol,
            'qty': quantity,
            'side': side.lower(),
            'type': 'trailing_stop',
            'time_in_force': 'gtc'  # Good till canceled
        }

        if trail_percent is not None:
            order_params['trail_percent'] = str(trail_percent)
            logger.info(f"Placing trailing stop: {side} {quantity} {symbol} with {trail_percent}% trail")
        else:
            order_params['trail_price'] = str(trail_price)
            logger.info(f"Placing trailing stop: {side} {quantity} {symbol} with ${trail_price} trail")

        # Submit order
        order = self.api.submit_order(**order_params)

        logger.info(f"✅ Trailing stop placed: {order.id}")
        return order.id

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error placing trailing stop: {e}")
        return None
```

2. Add method to cancel stop loss leg of bracket order:

```python
def cancel_stop_loss_leg(self, parent_order_id: str) -> bool:
    """
    Cancel the stop loss leg of a bracket order.

    Args:
        parent_order_id: The ID of the parent bracket order

    Returns:
        True if successfully cancelled, False otherwise
    """
    try:
        # Get all orders for this parent
        orders = self.api.list_orders(status='all', nested=True)

        for order in orders:
            # Find the stop loss child order
            if (hasattr(order, 'legs') and order.id == parent_order_id):
                for leg in order.legs:
                    if leg.order_type == 'stop':
                        logger.info(f"Cancelling stop loss leg: {leg.id}")
                        self.api.cancel_order(leg.id)
                        return True

        logger.warning(f"No stop loss leg found for order {parent_order_id}")
        return False

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error cancelling stop loss leg: {e}")
        return False
```

### Phase 2: Add Position Monitoring Logic

3. Add trailing stop upgrade logic to `proprietary_strategy.py`:

```python
async def upgrade_to_trailing_stop(self, symbol: str, position_data: Dict) -> bool:
    """
    Upgrade a position from fixed stop to trailing stop once profitable.

    Args:
        symbol: Stock symbol
        position_data: Position information including entry price and current price

    Returns:
        True if successfully upgraded, False otherwise
    """
    try:
        setup = position_data['setup']
        entry_price = setup.entry_price
        current_price = market_data_service.get_current_price(symbol)

        # Calculate profit percentage
        if setup.signal_type == SignalType.LONG:
            profit_pct = ((current_price - entry_price) / entry_price) * 100
        else:  # SHORT
            profit_pct = ((entry_price - current_price) / entry_price) * 100

        # Threshold: upgrade to trailing stop at +1% profit
        if profit_pct >= 1.0:
            logger.info(f"🔄 {symbol}: Upgrading to trailing stop (profit: {profit_pct:.2f}%)")

            # Cancel fixed stop loss from bracket order
            parent_order_id = position_data.get('order_id')
            if order_manager.cancel_stop_loss_leg(parent_order_id):

                # Place trailing stop (2% trail)
                side = 'sell' if setup.signal_type == SignalType.LONG else 'buy'
                trailing_stop_id = order_manager.place_trailing_stop(
                    symbol=symbol,
                    side=side,
                    quantity=setup.position_size,
                    trail_percent=2.0  # 2% trailing stop
                )

                if trailing_stop_id:
                    # Mark position as upgraded
                    position_data['has_trailing_stop'] = True
                    position_data['trailing_stop_id'] = trailing_stop_id
                    logger.info(f"✅ {symbol}: Trailing stop active (ID: {trailing_stop_id})")
                    return True

        return False

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error upgrading {symbol} to trailing stop: {e}")
        return False
```

4. Modify `monitor_positions()` method:

```python
async def monitor_positions(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Monitor active positions and upgrade to trailing stops when profitable.
    """
    exit_signals = []

    for symbol, pos_data in list(self.active_positions.items()):
        try:
            # Check if position needs trailing stop upgrade
            if not pos_data.get('has_trailing_stop', False):
                await self.upgrade_to_trailing_stop(symbol, pos_data)

            # Continue with regular monitoring...
            setup: TradeSetup = pos_data['setup']
            df = market_data_service.get_bars(symbol, timeframe='1Min', limit=5)

            if df is not None and len(df) > 0:
                current_price = df['close'].iloc[-1]

                # Calculate P/L
                pnl = (current_price - setup.entry_price) * setup.position_size
                if setup.signal_type == SignalType.SHORT:
                    pnl = -pnl

                # Log status
                trailing_status = "🔄 Trailing" if pos_data.get('has_trailing_stop') else "📍 Fixed Stop"
                logger.info(f"{trailing_status} {symbol}: Price=${current_price:.2f}, P/L=${pnl:.2f}")

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error monitoring position {symbol}: {e}")
            continue

    return exit_signals
```

## 📈 Configuration Recommendations

### Trailing Stop Percentage

Based on your strategy (gap trading with ATR-based stops):

- **Conservative:** 3-4% trail (protects more profit, may exit earlier)
- **Moderate:** 2-3% trail (balanced approach - RECOMMENDED)
- **Aggressive:** 1-2% trail (lets profits run, more volatile)

**Recommendation:** Start with **2% trail** since:
- Your ATR-based stops are already ~2 ATR (typically 2-4%)
- Matches gap trading volatility expectations
- Research-backed for day trading gaps

### Upgrade Trigger

When to switch from fixed stop to trailing stop:

- **Option A:** +0.5% profit (early protection, may limit gains)
- **Option B:** +1.0% profit (balanced - RECOMMENDED)
- **Option C:** +1.5% profit (more aggressive)
- **Option D:** When price reaches 0.5× ATR profit

**Recommendation:** **+1.0% profit** or **+0.5 ATR profit** (whichever comes first)

### Keep Take-Profit?

**YES - Keep take-profit order in place** because:
- ✅ Ensures you capture full gains if target is hit
- ✅ Trailing stop protects downside
- ✅ Take-profit captures upside
- ✅ Best of both worlds

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Example

**Trade Flow with Trailing Stops:**

```
09:45 AM - Entry: Buy 100 AAPL @ $100
          Fixed stop: $98.00 (2% ATR stop)
          Take profit: $105.00 (5% target)

09:50 AM - Price: $101.00 (+1.0% profit)
          🔄 UPGRADE TO TRAILING STOP
          Trailing stop placed: 2% trail
          Initial trailing stop: $98.98 (101 × 0.98)
          Take profit: Still active at $105.00

10:00 AM - Price: $103.00 (+3.0% profit)
          🔄 Trailing stop adjusts UP
          New trailing stop: $100.94 (103 × 0.98)
          Take profit: Still active at $105.00

10:15 AM - Price: $106.00 (+6.0% profit)
          🎯 TAKE PROFIT HIT - EXIT @ ~$105.00
          Profit: +$5.00/share × 100 = $500

Alternative outcome:

10:00 AM - Price: $103.00 (+3.0% profit)
          Trailing stop: $100.94

10:15 AM - Price drops to $102.00
          Trailing stop stays: $100.94 (doesn't move down)

10:20 AM - Price drops to $100.94
          🛑 TRAILING STOP TRIGGERED - EXIT @ ~$100.94
          Profit: +$0.94/share × 100 = $94 (protected!)
```

**Result:** You NEVER go back to negative once profitable! ✅

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Alpaca supports trailing stops** - fully functional
2. ❌ **Cannot use with bracket orders** (yet) - must use hybrid approach
3. ✅ **Hybrid approach is BEST** - bracket order for initial protection, upgrade to trailing stop when profitable
4. 📊 **Start with 2% trail** at +1% profit threshold
5. 🎯 **Keep take-profit active** - captures full gains if target hit
6. ⚙️ **Implementation is straightforward** - ~200 lines of code to add

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Phase 1:** Implement trailing stop methods in `order_manager.py`
2. **Phase 2:** Add upgrade logic to `proprietary_strategy.py`
3. **Phase 3:** Test with paper trading
4. **Phase 4:** Fine-tune trail percentage and upgrade threshold
5. **Phase 5:** Deploy to live trading

**Estimated Development Time:** 2-3 hours
**Testing Time:** 1-2 days of paper trading
**Expected Impact:** Significantly reduces "give back" of profits ✅
