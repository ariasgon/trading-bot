# Realistic Backtesting with Daily Market Scanning

## Overview

The backtesting engine now supports **realistic daily market scanning** - just like how the live trading bot operates!

Instead of manually picking stocks to backtest, the system now:
1. ‚úÖ Scans the entire stock universe each trading day
2. ‚úÖ Identifies top gapping stocks (just like pre-market)
3. ‚úÖ Only trades stocks that appear in daily scans
4. ‚úÖ Simulates real bot behavior day-by-day

## How It Works

### Old Way (Unrealistic)
```json
{
  "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"],  // Pre-selected stocks
  "start_date": "2025-08-01",
  "end_date": "2025-09-25"
}
```
**Problem**: You already know which stocks will be good!

### New Way (Realistic)
```json
{
  "symbols": null,  // Don't pre-select stocks!
  "start_date": "2025-08-01",
  "end_date": "2025-09-25",
  "use_daily_scanner": true  // Enable realistic scanning
}
```
**Benefit**: Bot discovers stocks each day like it would live!

## Daily Scanning Process

For **each trading day** during the backtest period:

### 1. Market Open Scan (9:30 AM)
```
üìä Scanning 200+ stocks from universe:
- S&P 500 components
- NASDAQ 100
- High-volume growth stocks
```

### 2. Gap Detection
Identifies stocks with:
- **Gap ‚â•1.5%** from previous close
- **Price range**: $5 - $1,000
- **Minimum volume**: 100k shares
- **Volume ratio**: 1.2x average

### 3. Stock Ranking
Ranks by composite score:
```python
gap_score = abs(gap_percent) * 0.7
volume_score = (volume_ratio - 1.0) * 30 * 0.3
total_score = gap_score + volume_score
```

### 4. Top Candidates Selected
- Takes **top 10** gapping stocks for the day
- These become the **only** tradeable stocks that day
- Applies Ichimoku strategy to filtered list

## Stock Universe

The scanner monitors **200+ liquid stocks**:

### Mega Cap Tech
- AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, NVDA, TSLA, NFLX, AMD, CRM

### Growth Stocks
- UBER, SHOP, SQ, ROKU, ZOOM, DOCU, PTON, ZM, SNOW, PLTR

### Chinese ADRs
- BABA, JD, PDD, NIO, XPEV, LI, TME, BILI

### ETFs & Leveraged
- SPY, QQQ, IWM, ARKK, SOXL, TQQQ, UVXY

### Blue Chips
- JPM, BAC, GS, V, MA, JNJ, PG, DIS, BA, CAT

*Full universe: 200+ symbols*

## Backtest Example

### Day 1: August 1, 2025
```
9:30 AM - Market Scan
üìä Scanned 200 stocks
‚úÖ Found 8 candidates:
   1. NVDA: Gap +3.2%, Vol 2.1x, Score 28.5
   2. AMD: Gap +2.8%, Vol 1.8x, Score 24.6
   3. TSLA: Gap +2.1%, Vol 2.5x, Score 22.3
   ...

Trading Day:
- Applies Ichimoku strategy to these 8 stocks only
- Enters trades when conditions meet
- Manages positions throughout day
```

### Day 2: August 2, 2025
```
9:30 AM - Market Scan
üìä Scanned 200 stocks
‚úÖ Found 12 candidates:
   1. AAPL: Gap +2.5%, Vol 1.9x, Score 25.1
   2. META: Gap +2.2%, Vol 2.3x, Score 23.8
   ...

Trading Day:
- New set of stocks to trade
- Previous day's stocks ignored if they don't gap today
- Fresh Ichimoku analysis on new candidates
```

## Running Realistic Backtests

### Option 1: Full Auto (Recommended)
```bash
POST /api/backtesting/run
{
  "symbols": null,
  "start_date": "2025-08-01",
  "end_date": "2025-09-25",
  "initial_capital": 100000,
  "use_daily_scanner": true
}
```

### Option 2: Mixed Mode
```bash
POST /api/backtesting/run
{
  "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA"],  // Still specify some
  "start_date": "2025-08-01",
  "end_date": "2025-09-25",
  "use_daily_scanner": false  // Trade only these symbols
}
```

   - Understand the difference

4. **Analyze Gap Distribution**
   - How many gaps per day?
   - What's the average gap size?
   - Are you getting enough opportunities?
