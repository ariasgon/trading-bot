# Position Close Time Fix - No Positions After 1 PM EST

**Date:** January 2025
**Fix:** Automatic position closure at 1 PM EST

---

## üéØ Problem

Positions were allowed to remain open past 1 PM EST, which creates risk:
- Lower trading volume in afternoon
- Increased volatility potential
- Gap risk if held overnight
- Reduced control over exits

**Required:** All positions must be closed by 1 PM EST

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

The bot now **automatically closes all open positions at exactly 1:00 PM EST** to ensure no positions remain open into the afternoon.

### How It Works:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Every monitoring cycle checks current EST time
   - Compares to position close cutoff (1:00 PM EST)

2. **Automatic Force Close**
   - When cutoff reached and positions are open
   - Cancels all bracket order legs
   - Cancels trailing stops if present
   - Submits market orders to close positions
   - Updates database records

3. **Clean Exit**
   - All orders cancelled properly
   - Positions removed from tracking
   - Database status updated to CLOSED

---

## üìä Trade Flow Example

### Normal Exit (Before 1 PM):

```
09:45 AM - Entry: Buy 100 AAPL @ $100
10:30 AM - Price rises to $103
11:15 AM - Trailing stop triggers at $100.94
           ‚úÖ Exit: +$0.94/share profit

Result: Normal strategy exit ‚úÖ
```

### Force Close at 1 PM:

```
09:45 AM - Entry: Buy 100 AAPL @ $100
11:30 AM - Price at $102 (position still open)
12:30 PM - Price at $103 (position still open)

01:00 PM - ‚è∞ POSITION CLOSING TIME REACHED

           Force closing position...
           1. Cancelled bracket order legs
           2. Cancelled trailing stop (if active)
           3. Submitted market order: SELL 100 AAPL
           4. Filled at market price: ~$103

           ‚úÖ Position closed at market

Result: Forced exit at 1 PM, no overnight risk ‚úÖ
```

## üîß Configuration

### In `app/strategies/proprietary_strategy.py`:

```python
# Time restrictions (lines 135-138)
self.trading_cutoff_hour = 12    # No NEW trades after 12 PM
self.position_close_hour = 13    # CLOSE all positions by 1 PM
self.position_close_minute = 0   # Close at exactly 1:00 PM
```

### Customization:

To change the close time, modify these parameters:

```python
# Close at 12:30 PM instead
self.position_close_hour = 12
self.position_close_minute = 30

# Close at 2:00 PM
self.position_close_hour = 14
self.position_close_minute = 0
```

**Recommended:** Keep default 1:00 PM for gap trading strategy

---

## üìù Code Changes

### 1. Added Time Check Method

**`_should_close_all_positions()`** (lines 225-239)
- Checks current EST time against close cutoff
- Returns True if past 1:00 PM EST
- Called every monitoring cycle

```python
def _should_close_all_positions(self) -> bool:
    """Check if we should force close all positions due to time cutoff."""
    est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
    current_time_est = datetime.now(est).time()
    close_time = time(self.position_close_hour, self.position_close_minute)

    if current_time_est >= close_time:
        return True

    return False
```

### 2. Added Force Close Method

**`force_close_position()`** (lines 1109-1191)
- Cancels all orders for the position
- Submits market order to close
- Updates position tracking
- Updates database status

```python
async def force_close_position(self, symbol: str, position_data: Dict, reason: str = "Time cutoff") -> bool:
    """Force close a position immediately with a market order."""
    # Cancel all orders (bracket legs, trailing stops)
    # Submit market close order
    # Update tracking and database
    # Return success/failure
```

### 3. Updated Monitor Positions

**`monitor_positions()`** (lines 1193-1220)
- Checks for time cutoff at start of method
- Force closes all positions if after 1 PM
- Returns early after closing (skips normal monitoring)

```python
async def monitor_positions(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Check time cutoff first
    if self._should_close_all_positions():
        # Force close all positions
        for symbol, pos_data in self.active_positions.items():
            await self.force_close_position(symbol, pos_data, "Time cutoff (1:00 PM EST)")
        return exit_signals

    # Normal monitoring continues...
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging

**`initialize_strategy()`** (lines 174-177)
- Logs time restrictions at startup
- Shows both trade cutoff and position close times

```python
logger.info(f"‚è∞ Time restrictions:")
logger.info(f"   New trades cutoff: {self.trading_cutoff_hour}:00 PM EST")
logger.info(f"   Position close time: {self.position_close_hour}:{self.position_close_minute:02d} PM EST")
```

## üìä Expected Log Output

### Startup:

```
‚úÖ Strategy initialized - Today's realized P/L: $0.00
‚è∞ Time restrictions:
   New trades cutoff: 12:00 PM EST
   Position close time: 1:00 PM EST
üîÑ Trailing stops: ENABLED
   Trail percentage: 2.0%
   Upgrade at profit: +1.0%
```

### When 1 PM Cutoff Reached:

```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Test:

1. **Simulate time cutoff** by temporarily changing close time:

```python
# In proprietary_strategy.py for testing
self.position_close_hour = 10  # Test at 10 AM instead
self.position_close_minute = 30
```

2. **Run bot and observe:**
   - Bot should close positions at 10:30 AM
   - Check logs for force close messages
   - Verify positions removed from tracking
   - Confirm database updated

3. **Restore production settings:**

```python
self.position_close_hour = 13  # Back to 1 PM
self.position_close_minute = 0
```

### Live Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Bot starts with time restrictions logged
- [ ] Normal trading occurs before noon
- [ ] New trades blocked after 12:00 PM
- [ ] Existing positions monitored 12:00-1:00 PM
- [ ] At 1:00 PM, force close triggered
- [ ] All orders cancelled properly
- [ ] Market close orders submitted
- [ ] Positions removed from active tracking
- [ ] Database records updated to CLOSED
- [ ] Bot remains idle after 1:00 PM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Market Order Execution:

- Force close uses **market orders** for guaranteed execution
- Execution price may differ slightly from last quote
- This is intentional - priority is closing positions, not price
- Small slippage acceptable for risk management

### Order Cancellation:

- All bracket order legs cancelled first
- Trailing stops cancelled if active
- Prevents conflicting orders
- Clean slate before market close order

### Database Consistency:

- Position status updated to CLOSED
- Maintains accurate position tracking
- Historical records preserved
- Supports proper P/L calculation

### Edge Cases Handled:

1. **No positions at 1 PM:** Method returns early, no action taken
2. **Order cancel fails:** Continues with position close anyway
3. **Position already closed:** Removed from tracking gracefully
4. **Multiple positions:** All closed sequentially

---

## üéØ Expected Impact

### Trading Discipline:

- **Forces intraday-only trading** - no overnight positions
- **Reduces risk exposure** - predictable daily closure
- **Improves consistency** - same pattern every day
- **Removes emotion** - automatic enforcement

### Performance Impact:

- **Minimal:** Most gap trades resolve by noon anyway
- **Positive:** Avoids afternoon whipsaws and reversals
- **Safety:** Eliminates overnight gap risk
- **Control:** Guaranteed clean slate daily

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Positions not closing at 1 PM

**Check:**
1. Is current time actually past 1 PM EST?
2. Are there actually open positions?
3. Check logs for errors during force close
4. Verify monitor_positions() is being called

**Debug:**
```python
# Add debug logging
logger.info(f"Current EST time: {datetime.now(est).time()}")
logger.info(f"Close time: {time(self.position_close_hour, self.position_close_minute)}")
logger.info(f"Active positions: {len(self.active_positions)}")
```

### Issue: Market close order fails

**Possible causes:**
1. Insufficient shares to close (quantity mismatch)
2. Symbol not tradable
3. Market closed
4. API connection issue

**Solution:**
- Check position quantity matches close order quantity
- Verify symbol status with Alpaca
- Ensure within market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
- Check API connectivity and credentials

## üí° Advanced Customization

### Graduated Position Closing:

Close positions progressively before cutoff:

```python
# Close 50% at 12:30 PM, rest at 1:00 PM
async def monitor_positions(self):
    est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
    current_time = datetime.now(est).time()

    # Partial close at 12:30 PM
    if current_time >= time(12, 30) and not self._partial_close_done:
        for symbol, pos_data in self.active_positions.items():
            # Close 50% of position
            half_size = pos_data['setup'].position_size // 2
            # Submit market order for half...
        self._partial_close_done = True

    # Full close at 1:00 PM
    if self._should_close_all_positions():
        # Close remaining positions...
```

### Weekend/Holiday Handling:

Skip close logic on weekends:

```python
def _should_close_all_positions(self) -> bool:
    est = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
    now = datetime.now(est)

    # Skip on weekends
    if now.weekday() >= 5:  # Saturday = 5, Sunday = 6
        return False

    # Check time as usual
    if now.time() >= time(self.position_close_hour, self.position_close_minute):
        return True

    return False
```
